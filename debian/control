Package: shell-script-helper
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Shell library - collection of functions commonly used in scripts
 This is a collection of shell functions commonly used in scripts (like
 checking if the script is run as root, ensuring that only one instance is
 running at the same time, print some messages only in verbose mode...),
 gathered in a single file that can be sourced at the beginning of a script.
 It allows one to easily write neat, powerful and (to some degree) error-prone
 shell scripts without reinventing the wheel each time.
